# Home Safe

## Description

Home Safe is a platform designed to encourage homeowners to take their safety into their own hands.

First responders have to deal with extreme conditions that make navigating an emergency situation difficult. When they have information like floor plans, locations of hazardous materials, roof type, and family member names, they can do their jobs more efficiently. This is where Home Safe comes in.

Home Safe gives homeowners an easy way to upload their pertinent safety information to be stored and displayed in a useful manner. It ecnourages users to complete a safety checklist, upload floor plans, and create a pre-incident plan to be printed and saved for display in the home. All of these features culminate to help homeowners get insurance breaks and offer first responders an amazing set of data that will help them do their job.

## Project Successes

MVP: As with most projects, it's easy to start with a vision that might be too large to accomplish in the alotted amount of time. We kept our dreams big, but made our MVP small. We new the core of the challenge was incentivizing homeowners to create pre-incident plans for firefighters, so that's exactly what we focused on, and that's what we finally built: an intuitive and elegant UX/UI that incentivise app use through gamification and insurance premium savings.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT: We only had 30 hours to create this project, so planning was key. Instead of jumping right in, we spent upwards of 4 hours of our limited time simply planning: DTRing, creating user stories, building out a robust Trello board, etc. Even though those 4 hours would have been great to use for sheer coding needs, the pre-planning was the only reason we were able to accomplish as much as we did.

## Project Challenges

TIME CONSTRAINTS: Again, timing is everything; and when you only have a day, you can only do so much. Peeling user stories off of our project managment board, especially when they would have added sooooo much to the project, is always a difficult experience.

## Project Extensions/Issues

* Building out a First Responder side of the app
* Create a more robust AWS backend that can handle massive image downloads
* Build out the app into a mobile platform
* Integrate 3D image rendering APIs into the mobile app so users can use their phone to create 3DHD scans of their house

## Project Tech Emphasis

* React
* Redux
* Forge

## Project Management

We used Trello for our project management needs. It was a great way to track our progress and keep ourselves on task.
