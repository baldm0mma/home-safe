### About

Home Safe is a platform designed to encourage homeowners to take their safety into their own hands.

First responders have to deal with extreme conditions that make navigating an emergency situation difficult. When they have information like floor plans, locations of hazardous materials, roof type, and family member names, they can do their jobs more efficiently. This is where Home Safe comes in.

Home Safe gives homeowners an easy way to upload their pertinent safety information to be stored and displayed in a useful manner. It ecnourages users to complete a safety checklist, upload floor plans, and create a pre-incident plan to be printed and saved for display in the home. All of these features culminate to help homeowners get insurance breaks and offer first responders an amazing set of data that will help them do their job.
